Instructions :

The application is based on Node.JS (express framework) and angular.js.
The application is running on localhost so in order to visualize multiple ip addresses
you will have to use server_test.js file instead of server.js file.
server_test.js file contains hard-coded ip adresses.

Node.js (for client real ip address): 

1. Download Node.JS : https://nodejs.org/en/ 
3. Download hello_marketsApp from github : https://github.com/assaelaz/hello_marketsApp
4. Open Node.js cmd and change your current directory path to hello_marketsApp directory path.
5. Start the server by typing : "node server.js" - server is running
6. Open browser tab - http://localhost:8080

Node.js (for testing multiple ip addresses on localhost): 

1. Download Node.JS : https://nodejs.org/en/ 
3. Download hello_marketsApp from github : https://github.com/assaelaz/hello_marketsApp.
4. Open Node.js cmd and change your current directory path to hello_marketsApp directory path.
5. Start the server by typing : "node server_test.js" - server is running.
6. Open multiple browser tabs (limit to 4) - http://localhost:8080 .
7. Each tab will receive a different ip address.
 

Enjoy.
